### Usage Guidance

- All code is organised in the `code` folder.
- Unix and bioinformatics scripts are in `code/unix`.
- R analysis scripts are stored in `code/r_scripts`.
- Scripts are grouped by major steps and ordered accordingly:
  - Environmental data extraction: `Env_X`
  - Distance extraction between points (including "As-the-fish-swims" and Euclidean distances): `Distances_X`
  - Population genomics: `Gen_X`
  - Redundancy analysis: `RDA_X`
